# CGE_demo
This code is the framework of the proposed framwork CGE

To compare our framework with existing post-hoc explanation methods, please run main.py.
For example, to compare GNNExplainer with CGE-GNNExplainer in the dataset MUTAG, please add 5 (GNNExplainer) and 11 (CGE-GNNExplainer) to the list of Explainers in explain_module\utils\parser.py, then run main.py. 

ThanksÔºÅ
